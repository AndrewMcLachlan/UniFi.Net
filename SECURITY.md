# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We release patches for security vulnerabilities as needed.  
Only the most recent stable release is supported with security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
⚠️ Please **do not** open a public issue for security concerns.

Instead, use GitHub’s [Private Vulnerability Reporting](../../security/advisories/new) feature.  
This creates a private advisory that is only visible to the maintainers.

We aim to respond to new reports within **5 business days**.

If you are unable to use the private vulnerability reporting feature, please check the repository’s **Security** tab for alternative contact details.
